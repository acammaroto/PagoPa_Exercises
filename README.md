# PagoPa_Exercises 1 & 2

## Exercise 1
Write some code that, giving an array of string, will prints out the number of occurrences where a char is repeated at least 1 time

```swift
let input1: [String] = ["a","b","c"] //result:  0
let input2: [String] = ["a","b","cc"] //result: 1
let input3: [String] = ["abc","deef","hi", "mnmn"] //result: 2
let input4: [String] = ["abc","deef","hi", "mnmn", "pippo"] //result: 3
let input5: [String] = ["abc","deef","hi", "mnmn", "pippo", "che mal di schiena"] //result: 4
```

## Exercise 2
Write some code that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers

```swift
let myArray1 = [[1,2,[[3]],[4]]] as [Any]
// result: [1,2,3,4]
```
